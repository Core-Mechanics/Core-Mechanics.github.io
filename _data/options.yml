  review: "Historically blood-based blessings have been variable, but the potential ceiling here is _very_ high. A few teams already have blood blessings and won't want this, but those that don't will probably invest heavily here."

  definition: "Move a player to a different position on the team. This can include moves in and out of the shadows"
  review: "Our players are mostly in the right places, but Torus is a notable weakness in our rotation. He's not a great batter either, but we could also Move him to the Shadows, out of play altogether."
