  review: "Our players are mostly in the right places, but Torus is a notable weakness in our rotation. He's not a great batter either, but he'd do less harm from there."

  review: "This season we might aim to bank one of our stronger players, to set us up for extra party time next season and take advantage of the many buffs that target the shadows in this election." 

- name: "Reform (Jasper + Minimalist)"
  value: 0
  type: Will
  review: "We don't know exactly how Reform works yet, but the possibility of replacing a debuff (even one that doesn't fire very much) with a buff is interesting."

  review: "Combining two Wills into one is tempting, but most of our players risk coming out weaker than before as an Alternate."

  review: "Trading players can be a sensitive subject - we'll generally only recommend it if there's a plan with agreement from both out and the other team."

  review: "A nerfed Infuse is still potentially powerful. Transfuse is better for pitchers than batters, as they are less likely to make use of the lost stars."

  type: Will
  review: "Right now, we're unlikely to be a serious competitor, so Enrich would mainly benefit us by increasing the benefits of our party time."
