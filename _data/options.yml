  review: "Historically blood-based blessings have been variable, but the potential ceiling here is _very_ high. A few teams already have blood blessings and won't want this, but those that don't will probably invest heavily here."

  review: "Our worst hitter is Evelton McBlase II, who is Romain' and unlikely to stick around forever. That's a bit sad, since Fourth Strike is very powerful."
