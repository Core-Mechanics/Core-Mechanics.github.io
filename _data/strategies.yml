Alternating Evelton should hopefully improve the player. Or at the very least do something fun. And finally, there's literally no reason we shouldn't have AAA blood."

  description: "There are a lot of good Wills plans, and tbh they all seem pretty equal in power. Let people vote where they want and let's focus on getting AAA blood for the team. Wills and player-focused blessings are prone to weather, exchanges, plunders, etc. But team wide boosts will (generally) persist through it all. Let's have a target of 80% of our total votes toward Power Chaaarge and let people vote the rest where they want (with some guidance e.g. no Fire Blood, no Sweet Relief)"
