    - text: "How would this work? Well, here's the main advantage of Project Streamline - it's modular! In stage one, we could choose to Move Jolene Willowtree (nb: if Jolene dies replace this with [best pitcher]) to the shadows, leaving us with a rotation that's 33.3% weak spot and sending us on a quick route to party time! Or, if we want to get our pitching back in the direction of looking good, we could give our new friend Alternate Dot a break with a Move to the shadows!"
    - text: "We could end it there, on a three-pitcher rotation, or we could keep pushing those buttons."
    - text: "After the siesta, we would then choose another pitcher to Move to the shadows. Depending on how things are looking post-siesta, we could double down on a tank strat by sending Mindy or Shirai into the Shadows, or optimize the rotation down to 2 by Moving the weakest pitcher."

    - text: "The first one is, controversially, resilience: In the event of incineration, sharkbite, theft, wimdy, casual murder, reality breaking down etc, we can simply foreshadow and swap for another strong pitcher in storage. As part of this, we would also target any blessings or decrees or wills that boosted our shadows thus boosting them further. If we had a selection of strong pitchers and had good luck one season, we could rotate them anyway to make them harder targets for plunder."
    - text: "Oh, speaking of plunder. Benefit number two: Having a one pitcher rotation means that if we want to flash the uno reverse card, we can do so easily. If we lose a pitcher we want back, then we get them on the idol board, stack plunder votes, and know exactly who we're going to send in return. Handy!"
    - text: "And speaking of things that are handy, imagine having a season where five batters die and two get Consumed and maybe someone has a peanut allergy. Things are looking pretty dire.

    - text: "Statistically speaking it is easier to ensure good outcomes on wills with fewer votes if you spread your votes on more than 2 ( or 3 if we get a bonus will ). Ensuring we get 2 out of 3 wills is easier than ensuring 2 out of 2. To increase our chances of getting a good outcome in the election, I propose we modularly add wills to our chosen strategy."

For example if the chosen strategy only has 2 targeted wills and we don't end up in the bottom 4, we would choose the top priority will from the list below that works with the strategy.

Since this is something that we will want to do in the future, Foreshadowing mindy now for either a potential good Pitcher (Like Cravel or Torus) or a potential good Batter would get Mindy closer to going back in rotation when we need her, give her a shadow boost and give one of our shadow players an opportunity to party. Note that this might be dangerous if we decide to Punder Zoey and the Steaks foreshadow her - the target would need to be chosen accordingly from where we know zoey won't have a chance to switch with Mindy."

    - text: "Maximalist on Gia or a Pitcher - these mods are going to proc very rarely and we could get something better."
    - text: "Homebody on Lady - it makes her inconsisten across the season an more importantly in playoffs (We suspect Overperforming/Underperforming will be removed when it gets rerolled, but it's something to keep in mind as rerolling it if she ends the season Underperforming has a very small chance of leaving her with permanent Underperforming). Triple Threat - if one of our pitchers ends the season with Triple Threat, which with Sweetener we have a decent chance of happening, we could reroll it to get a free mod (I do not suggest doing this mid season since this strategy is supposed to compliment other strategies, not compete with them)."
