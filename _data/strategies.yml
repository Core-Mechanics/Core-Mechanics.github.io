    - text: "How would this work? Well, here's the main advantage of Project Streamline - it's modular! In stage one, we could choose to Move Jolene Willowtree (nb: if Jolene dies replace this with [best pitcher]) to the shadows, leaving us with a rotation that's 33.3% weak spot and sending us on a quick route to party time! Or, if we want to get our pitching back in the direction of looking good, we could give our new friend Alternate Dot a break with a Move to the shadows!"
    - text: "We could end it there, on a three-pitcher rotation, or we could keep pushing those buttons."
    - text: "After the siesta, we would then choose another pitcher to Move to the shadows. Depending on how things are looking post-siesta, we could double down on a tank strat by sending Mindy or Shirai into the Shadows, or optimize the rotation down to 2 by Moving the weakest pitcher."
    - text: "Now we could end it there, on a two-pitcher rotation. Or we could push those buttons again!"
    - text: "From our two remaining pitchers we would then choose another to Move to the shadows (either tripling down on the tank strat or sending our then weakest pitcher)."
    - text: "So, a one pitcher rotation? Well, why? What's the benefit?"
    - text: "The first one is, controversially, resilience: In the event of incineration, sharkbite, theft, wimdy, casual murder, reality breaking down etc, we can simply foreshadow and swap for another strong pitcher in storage. As part of this, we would also target any blessings or decrees or wills that boosted our shadows thus boosting them further. If we had a selection of strong pitchers and had good luck one season, we could rotate them anyway to make them harder targets for plunder."
    - text: "Oh, speaking of plunder. Benefit number two: Having a one pitcher rotation means that if we want to flash the uno reverse card, we can do so easily. If we lose a pitcher we want back, then we get them on the idol board, stack plunder votes, and know exactly who we're going to send in return. Handy!"
    - text: "And speaking of things that are handy, imagine having a season where five batters die and two get Consumed and maybe someone has a peanut allergy. Things are looking pretty dire. But not for long! We can bring out a pitcher who should probably definitely not be pitching and simply lose every game and get the party benefit and then turn things around with one will!

    - text: "These would be wills that compliment it or don't act against it. For example if the chosen strategy only has 2 targeted wills and we don't end up in the bottom 4, we would choose the top priority will from the list below that works with the strategy.

Since this is something that we will want to do in the future, Foreshadowing mindy now for either a potential good Pitcher (Like Cravel or Torus) or a potential good Batter would get Mindy closer to going back in rotation when we need her, give her a shadow boost and give one of our shadow players an opportunity to party. Note that this might be dangerous if we decide to Punder Zoey and the Steaks foreshadow her - the target would need to be chosen accordingly from where we know zoey won't have a chance to switch with Mindy."

It's only not as good if we expect to make a good push for a playoff spot, limiting our party time days, in which case we could Enrich Fourth Strike (this is highly unlikely, but is an option)"
    - text: "Priority 4: Reform"
    - text: "Reform won't do a lot for us currently, we don't have any generally bad Mods on our team, the only one being Homebody which is a mixed bag. If the above will options aren't compatible with the plan chosen or if we need another option (due to getting a 3rd will) it's still a relatively safe Will. We have multiple targets for it:"
    - text: "Maximalist on Gia or a Pitcher - these mods are going to proc very rarely and we could get something better."
    - text: "Homebody on Lady - it makes her inconsisten across the season an more importantly in playoffs (We suspect Overperforming/Underperforming will be removed when it gets rerolled, but it's something to keep in mind as rerolling it if she ends the season Underperforming has a very small chance of leaving her with permanent Underperforming). Triple Threat - if one of our pitchers ends the season with Triple Threat, which with Sweetener we have a decent chance of happening, we could reroll it to get a free mod (I do not suggest doing this mid season since this strategy is supposed to compliment other strategies, not compete with them)."

There are a couple ways of doing this, so I'm submitting a couple ideas. This one is more heavily focused on getting us to the best place we can long term using incremental steps to improve the team each season. First, we Move Bottles to the Shadows with the intention of Foreshadowing Mindy for them next season to get them back in the lineup. This allows us to control where we put them so we don't have to risk losing Bottles to a Zoey shadow Plunder next season, and gets us one step closer to fixing our Reverbed mess.  Second, we Transfuse the batting of a non-Lady, Evelton, Mira, or Mindy batter to further boost our lineup."

First, we Move Bottles to the shadows. Using move allows us to choose where they end up, and reduces the risk of us losing them in a Zoey Plunder. Second, we Foreshadow Dot for Cravel. This gets our good shadows pitcher into the rotation, which is exactly what we saved them for. This leaves us with 3 solid to great pitchers back in our rotation, which should slingshot us back towards contention and could pair well with the party time boosts our lineup receives this season."
